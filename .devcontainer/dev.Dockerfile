# *NOTE: Dockerfile scope behaviorâ€”arguments (ARG) and environment variables (ENV) work in different phases of the build process.
#   Docker does not carry ARG values beyond layers unless explicitly restated.
#   ARG variables are only available during the build stage but do not persist into later layers unless explicitly reassigned.
#   ENV variables persist and are available at runtime when the container is running.
